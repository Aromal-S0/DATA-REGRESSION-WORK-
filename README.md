This program predicts the **median house value** (`MedHouseVal`) using a regression model.  

The steps included in the program are:  
- Load and preprocess the California Housing dataset.  
- Train a regression model on the data.  
- Evaluate the model using **MAE, MSE, and R²**.  
- Interpret the results and assess model performance.
